            <p>School districts only miles away can have vastly different funding situations. Our map aims to display this difference in funding between school districts in the <em>District View</em>. Within this view, the map displays funding metrics such as the Equalized Property Value, Local Revenue Per Student, and State Revenue Per Student. Users can also view the racial demographic data of each school district, to see the clear correlation between districts with less minority students and more funding. </p>
            <p>In the <em>County View</em> of the mapping, we aim to show what a possible redistricting would look like if NJ had one school district per county. Within this view, we again show the Equalized Property Value, as well as demographic data.</p>
            <h5>Key Terms:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Revenue Per Student</strong> - Local funds for NJ schools come from property taxes within the district</li>
                <li><strong>State Revenue Per Student</strong> - The state covers the difference between what the school district is calculated to need and what can be provided by local revenue</li>
                <li><strong>Equalized Property Value</strong> - The assessed value of a property standardized by an equalization ratio that is based off of sales. Used as a relative estimator of local revenue sources</li>
